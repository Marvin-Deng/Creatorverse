# Creatorverse - *CodePath WEB103 Prework*
CreatorVerse is a web application designed to empower users to showcase and curate their favorite content creators from various online platforms.  By providing a platform for sharing and discovering talent, Creatorverse enhances the overall content consumption experience and helps creators gain more recognition for their work. Made using React.js, HTML, CSS, and Postgres.

## What I learned
- Effectively passing props and states between multiple pages and modals
- Developing reusable and responsive components and pages for improved code organization
- Utilizing query parameters in URLs to embed and pass data as props between different pages
